“Cheesybay” sells “faulty Hard drives” on eBay. All the reviews are GLOWING in ways that are bizarre given that he’s self-reportedly selling “junk”.

Compound in Hawaii has vats/barrels with what looks like the remain of rendering processes (dissolving tissues).

There’s waek wifi signals coming from underneath the shed that indicate there’s something underneath it.

“Bif Skipman” runs a “distillery” business at that address. It’s an alias, of an alias, of an alias.

David Stone is “Bif Skipman” accoding to several links including the brand of hawaiian vodka he sells being seen at the “Bif Skipman” compound.

E-mails dug out of his gmail account reference a “Richard Windsor” Pseudonym that Lisa P. Jackson was caught using.

She works for the Clinton Foundation. The e-mail is possibly from the Music booker at Comet Ping Pong pizza.

The pizza place owned by the former gay boyfriend of David Brock, the CEO of Correct The Record and the venue for dozens of events for the Hillary campaign staff.

It’s also a dive that according to reviews and photo has hidden bathroom doors and creepy murals.

But that’s just the summary.
Hold on to your butts

    “Get served at Comet Ping Pong, a hipster-heavy pizza parlor in the Upper Northwest with rough concrete walls, bathrooms hidden behind secret panels, and table tennis galore. Thin crust pies from the wood-burning oven are as much of an attraction as the regularly scheduled live bands.”

Podesta’s invitation to an AFTER party at David Brock home (pic related, was attached in email)

The company that planned the event has a long roster.

    “Here’s a party tip: If you’re hosting an impromptu dinner and want guests to show up, have Academy Award-winner Mira Sorvino as your guest of honor.

    That’s exactly what Kimball Stroud did after Sorvino attended a briefing on child trafficking on Capitol Hill with Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.), filmmaker Libby Spears (“Playground”) and several survivors of child trafficking.”

Podesta e-mail with HRC pizza logo (Design provided by James Alefantis) says to donate to “PizzaPAC.com” registered to one JZ Drizin; Most recent tweet is retweet from Pizza Packet, company that sells and delivers nothing but seasoning packets for pizza

His home address is

http://archive.is/GlWyl

pizzapacket.com is a legit business and there products do get used by many pizza chains. HOWEVER…

Address listed for Pizza Packet on their website goes to a post office in Florida (30 minutes from the Epstein mansion though). Also owns Frapes LLC

http://archive.is/EgCwX

Address listed for a sponsor of a Pizza Packet contest (762 Park Place, NYC, NY);

https://i.sli.mg/4uH0eR.png

Streetview of this address shows a business name of “AR medical & Dental Supply Corp and a website address. That domain is inactive, but was crawled by the wayback machine successfully a few times.

https://web.archive.org/web/20040525172103/http://www.ardentalsupply.com/

The phone number if googled indicates that the business moved to a new location, and the owner of that business probably failed to remove the awning before relocating, so that lead is a dead end. The ownership of the 762 park place address is currently unknown.

However, Pizza Packet is owned by “Itchie Gross”; Richard “Itchie” Gross LinkedIn profile has picture of a commercial jet.

What does MyStateUSA\AlertSense do? According to their own website: “AlertSense offers a highly intuitive mass notification solution that simplifies alert creation & help mobilize and manage the emergency response teams.”

They’re the contractor that supplies early response cell-based equipment that a few dozen states use for their AMBER ALERT systems as well as hazardous weather and emergency preparedness update systems.

    The new system was developed by MyStateUSA, a company based in Boise, Idaho that is also involved in a 12-state pilot project with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate interoperability among public warning alert systems.

Former Georgia State Senator, Nancy Schaefer was an outspoken opponent of Child Protective Services (CPS). Schaefer authored an investigation in which, among other findings, revealed the following: “…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets. The Adoption and the Safe Families Act, set in motion by President Bill Clinton, offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child. In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as The Second Mile, procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.

Schaefer and her husband died under very mysterious circumstances at their home in Georgia in March of 2010.
