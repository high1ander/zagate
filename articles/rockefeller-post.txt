So this post has been removed twice from the_donald, or I might just be shadowbanned. Cant see any of my comments or posts over there, trying here. This post involves a potential link between Rockefeller's and John Podesta. Here is the research I have compiled.

Decided to check out the person who made the strange comments about kids in the podesta email

        We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.

It sounds odd, but I'm pretty sure Maeve Luzzatto is the daughter of Tamera Luzzatto, the sender of the invite. More importantly who is this person.

UPDATE: Tamera Luzzatto appears to be the grandmother of all 3 Children

    Ruby, Emerson and Maeve are the children of Alexandra Tydings, the actress who played the goddess Aphrodite on Xena the Warrior Princess.

    She is married to Benjamin Luzatto, son of Tamara Luzzato’s ex husband.

So begins the breadcrumbs.

    Luzzatto served as then-Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s chief of staff from 2001 to 2009.

*Nothing to odd about that

    Hired without an interview straight out of John D. Rockefellar IV's staff after serving him 15 years.

    In 1985, she went to work as a legislative assistant for Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.). Fifteen years later, she was working as Rockefeller's chief of staff when Clinton called and without even a single job interview asked if Luzzatto would become hers.

*That's odd

    Rockefeller's can be tied to shady stuff just on their Wiki page, including tied to the Clinton's

        In 1993, Rockefeller became the principal Senate supporter, with Ted Kennedy, behind Bill and Hillary Clinton's sweeping health care reform package, liaising closely with the First Lady, opening up his mansion next to Rock Creek Park for its first strategy meeting. The reform was subsequently defeated by an alliance between the Business Roundtable and a small-business coalition.

    What are these "advisory panels"?

    -Pepper Commission on Health Care - This needs further research, something about healthcare?

    -National Commission on Children -

        The National Commission on Children is a bi-partisan panel established by Public Law 100-203, which was signed by President Reagan, on December 22, 1987. Composed of members of Congress, representatives of organizations providing services to children and representatives from parents' organizations, the purpose is "to serve as a forum on behalf of the children of the nation" and to make recommendations to the President and Congress on the state of children in America. The Commission held 11 Public Meetings across the country, called 14 meetings for Commissioners, assembled briefings for Congressional Staff, and convened briefings for Commission members composed of members from the public and professional communities. The Commission held a regional forum, and convened a National Summit. The Commission produced an interim report in April 1990, a Final Report on June 21, 1991, a Summary of the Final Report, and a survey released on Nov. 19, 1991. The Commission distributed a Video Curriculum to the Schools of Social Work across the country, produced a series of implementation guides derived from the recommendations of the Commission and prepared a media ' resource guide of quick facts for the press and Congress. The Commission will be closed on April 3, 1993

        One of the things they did during that time from was data collection on children:

        National Opinion Survey. The Commission designed and conducted a national telephone survey of children ages 10 to 17, their parents, and parents of children under age 10. Approximately 1700 households were interviewed. In addition, the Commission added a module of questions to the 1990 General Social Survey, an annual face- to-face survey administered by NORC at the University of Chicago. Documentation includes questionnaires for both surveys; several volumes of survey results for the full samples and for subsamples based on race, family income, family structure, and other variables; data tapes for the survey of children and parents; analysis of the survey finding; correspondence to Commission members and to the Commission's technical advisors and a Fact Sheet on findings and News Release of Findings.

    Who was in charge of the National Commission of Children? Commission's Executive Director, Cheryl D. Hayes

    Looking into her she also worked on "The Finance Project" Cheryl D. Hayes, with assistance from Margaret J. Flynn and Helene Stebbins, The Finance Project

    -Finance Project Overview

        As states build comprehensive early childhood systems, policy leaders will need to be attentive to the funding streams available to communities to achieve desired returns. Most public funding for early care and education, as well as for other health and social services for young children and their families is categorical. Categorical funding streams are narrowly defined funding streams that support highly specialized activities and specifically targeted populations. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau’s (MCHB) State Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (SECCS) Initiative gives states an opportunity to think more strategically about how early childhood services are delivered and funded. This report identifies financing strategies to support comprehensive systems-building efforts.

    Then another company pops up from him - McKinsey & Company

    McKinsey & Company is a worldwide management consulting firm. It conducts qualitative and quantitative analysis in order to evaluate management decisions across the public and private sectors. Widely considered the most prestigious management consultancy,[4] McKinsey's clientele includes 80% of the world's largest corporations, and an extensive list of governments and non-profit organisations. More current and former Fortune 500 C.E.O.s are alumni of McKinsey than of any other company, a list including Google C.E.O. Sundar Pichai, Facebook C.O.O. Sheryl Sandberg, Morgan Stanley C.E.O. James P. Gorman, and many more. McKinsey publishes the McKinsey Quarterly, funds the McKinsey Global Institute research organization, publishes reports on management topics, and has authored many influential books on management. Its practices of confidentiality, influence on business practices, and corporate culture have experienced a polarizing reception.

    What else have they done?

    I am not entirely sure yet what other information lay within this site - other than it links Mckinsey & Company to the Rockefeller foundation

*Note - Too many coincidences with little effort, just a few clicks to connect Rockefeller's, Clinton's and something to do with "helping" children, plus global locations.

Any other inputs, validations or thoughts are much appreciated. Keep on the good work fellow revolutionaries!

TLDR: Potential Rockefeller link that could help lead to finding the puppet masters of the pedo ring?

UPDATE: Turns out there was an even better link between the Rockefellers and the Clinton Cartel.

    The Rockefeller Foundation provided a $900,000 grant to Center for American Progress (John Podesta's PAC) that JUST ended OCT 31, 2016
